Abstract: Conflicts between legal norms are common in reality. In many legislations, legal conflicts between norms are resolved by applying ordered principles. This work presents a formalization of the conflict resolution mechanism and introduces action legal logic ($$\mathtt{ALL}$$⁠⁠) to reason about the normative consequences of possibly conflicting legal systems. The semantics of $$\mathtt{ALL}$$ is explicitly based on legal systems consisting of norms and ordered principles. Legal systems specify the legal status of transitions in transition systems and the language of  $$\mathtt{ALL}$$ describes the legal status of paths in transition systems. The formalization is used to study abstract revisions of legal systems. The expressivity of $$\mathtt{ALL}$$ is studied and its completeness is proved.
