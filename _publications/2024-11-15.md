Abstract: Deontic logic aims to formalize normative reasoning involving deontic modalities such as "obligation" and "permission", and theoretically it should align with the needs of legal artificial intelligence (AI). However, in practice deontic logic is not the primary tool for formalizing normative reasoning in legal AI, and its typical applications are limited. This is mainly because deontic logic has not developed sufficiently to meet the requirements of automated legal reasoning, and its strengths in intensional characterization of deontic modalities do not match the types of normative reasoning found in legal practice. With regard to application in legal AI, deontic logic should focus on scenarios involving intensional normative reasoning. In such direction, legal reasoning in multi-agent systems may become a new breakthrough for integrating deontic logic with legal AI.
