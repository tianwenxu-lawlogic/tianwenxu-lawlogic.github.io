Abstract: The fundamental relations in private law are claims and duties. These legal relations can be changed by agents with the appropriate legal powers. We use propositional dynamic logic and ideas about propositional control from the agency literature to formalize these changes in legal relations. Our models are sets of states with functions specifying atomic facts, agents’ abilities to change atomic facts, legal relations between agents concerning changing atomic facts and agents’ powers. We present a formal language that allows us to describe models and changes of models caused by two kinds of actions: actions that change atomic facts and actions that change legal relations. Next, we present a sound and complete calculus for this language. The paper demonstrates that the perspective on actions borrowed from computer science can be used to shed interesting light on the dynamics of legal relations.
