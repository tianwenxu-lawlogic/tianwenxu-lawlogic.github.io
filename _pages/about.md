I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Guanghua Law School, Zhejiang University, member of the Zhejiang University Law and AI Laboratory, and member of the Zhejiang University-University of Luxembourg Joint Lab on Advanced Intelligent Systems and Reasoning. 

My research interests focus on computational legal theory, especially formal models of legal reasoning based on modal logic or formal argumentation. Some of my specific research topics include: legal knowledge representation, dynamics of legal relations, normative multi-agent systems, multi-criteria legal decision making. Besides logic, I am also interested in the legal and ethical issues of artificial intelligence, in particular formal frameworks for machine agents to conduct normative reasoning and to implement legal or moral norms among them.

Currently I am leading the research project "Multi-criteria Decision Methods for Smart Justice" granted by Zhejiang Province Social Science Foundation. The project is mainly about assisting judicial decision making with multi-criteria decision methods. I have also been participating in another research project "Strategic Reasoning in Dynamic Context", granted by the National Social Science Foundation of China.
