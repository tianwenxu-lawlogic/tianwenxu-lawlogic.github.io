I am a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Philosophy, Nanjing University. I am also member of the Zhejiang University Law and AI Lab, and member of the Zhejiang University-University of Luxembourg Joint Lab on Advanced Intelligent Systems and Reasoning. 

My research interests are logics for computational legal theory. Some of my recent research topics are: 

(1) Logic of action, especially dynamic logic that can capture different types of agents’ actions and their nonphysical effects (e.g., normative effects, which are independent of what the world is); 

(2) Normative multi-agent system, especially introducing legal concepts for multi-agent systems, by which more subtle normative positions between agents can be defined; 

(3) Decision under uncertainty, especially when multiple criteria or belief dynamics is involved, which in turn requires rational decision methods, rational models of belief change or non-monotonic reasoning mechanism. 

Besides, I am also interested in the legal and ethical issues of artificial intelligence, in particular formal frameworks for machine agents to conduct normative reasoning and to implement legal or moral norms among them.


Currently I am leading the research project "Integrating Large Language Model and Theories of Legal Reasoning", granted by the National Social Science Foundation of China (No.25CFX003).
