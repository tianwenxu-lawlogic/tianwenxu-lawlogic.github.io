I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Guanghua Law School, Zhejiang University. I am also member of the Zhejiang University Law and AI Laboratory, and member of the Zhejiang University-University of Luxembourg Joint Lab on Advanced Intelligent Systems and Reasoning. 

My research interests are: (1) Logic of action, especially dynamic logic that can capture different types of agentsâ€™ actions and their nonphysical effects (e.g., normative effects, which are independent of what the world is); (2) Normative multi-agent system, especially introducing legal concepts for multi-agent systems, by which more subtle normative positions between agents can be defined; (3) Decision under uncertainty, especially when multiple criteria or belief dynamics is involved, which in turn requires rational decision methods or rational models of belief change. Besides, I am also interested in the legal and ethical issues of artificial intelligence, in particular formal frameworks for machine agents to conduct normative reasoning and to implement legal or moral norms among them.


Currently I am leading the research project "Multi-criteria Decision Methods for Smart Justice" granted by Zhejiang Province Social Science Foundation. I have also been participating in another research project "Strategic Reasoning in Dynamic Context", granted by the National Social Science Foundation of China.
